The folowing two files train the two networks: 
Letter_classification_using_feedforward_network.m
Letter_classification_using_SVM.m

Run the Letter_classification_using_feedforward_network.m scriopt first as this splits and randomly shuffles the data. This split and shuffle is then used by the Letter_classification_using_SVM.m script.
